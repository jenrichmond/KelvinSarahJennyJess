This site documents analysis for the MTT anxiety project. You can find links to individual .RMD files below. 

# Data cleaning

1. [Get data in format for R](mtt_study3_cleaning.html)
- This file reads the dummy and specificity data from excel, cleans it up, gets it into long format and exports to csv


# Plotting

1.  [Overgenerality plots](mtt_study3_plotting1.html)
- This file tries to replicate the plots in the manuscript draft, i.e dummy scores by direction and valence. Noticing that we might not be plotting the same data- plot by valence looks like there is no effect (whereas in the original analysis there was). 
- Also clear that the dummy scores are highly skewed; most participants have scores of 5 or 6 (out of 6). Not sure that repeated-measures ANOVA is a good option. 
- TO DO....
  + check to make sure we are dealing with the same data
plots dummy scores 
  + what do other papers do re analysing overgen scores, are they dealing with a larger range of possible scores?
  + alternative to RM ANOVA?

2. [Specificity plots-work in progress](mtt_study3_plotting2.html)
- just includes main effect group plot thus far, need to dig into direction/valence/group
